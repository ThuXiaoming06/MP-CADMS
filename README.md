We developed an M-protein Computer-Aided Diagnosis and monitoring System (MP-CADMS) based on deep learning. 
Here we release our Python codes for peer review. The code will be improved over time. 
And soon we will also make our self-collected dataset of single-modal IFE data available here.

System Requirement
=======
**Software:** The development and validation of MP-CADMS are based on Python 3.10.5 and PyTorch 1.12.0. Data analysis is conducted using libraries NumPy 1.23.1, pandas 1.4.4, matplotlib 3.5.2, SciPy 1.8.1, and scikit-learn 1.1.1.

**Hardtware:** The model training, validation and data analysis are performed using NVIDIA RTX 3060Ti GPUs, 256G RAM, and an Intel Core i7-8700 CPU.
